        This archive provides highly secure and durable long-term storage for digital files. Those packets are called <strong>Knowledge Items</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        <strong>Knowledge Items</strong> include metadata and attachments. The metadata determines who
        has access to the item and how long they will be stored in The Vault.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        <strong>Attachments</strong> are converted to PDF documents automatically and digitally
        signed to ensure they can never be modified once submitted.
